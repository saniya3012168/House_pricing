# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project builds a simple Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on numerical features. It covers data cleaning, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Steps Performed
1. Load and explore dataset  
2. Handle missing values  
3. Select features & target  
4. Train Linear Regression model  
5. Predict house prices  
6. Evaluate model (MSE, R² score)  
7. Visualize Actual vs Predicted  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab  

## How to Run
Upload the dataset in Google Colab → Run all cells → View predictions and graphs.
